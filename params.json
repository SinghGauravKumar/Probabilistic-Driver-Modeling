Although there are many functions on kMeans created by collaborators, we decided to use the inbuilt command of MATLAB, as it provides more flexibility.\r\n\r\n#### k_means_clustering_training.m trains on a vehicle dynamics dataset (collected on a regular day) and tests on about 40% of data kept aside for testing.\r\n\r\n#### clustering_performance_testing_rainyday.m trains on a vehicle dynamics dataset (collected on a regular day) and tests on another dataset by the same driver on a rainyday. \r\n",
